# gent-Based-Wildfire-Simulation-and-Evacuation-Model-with-Multi-Threading
This project is an agent-based simulation model designed to study wildfire spread and evacuation strategies. The model leverages multi-threading to efficiently simulate the interactions between fire, environment, and agents (such as people or vehicles) in a dynamic landscape.
