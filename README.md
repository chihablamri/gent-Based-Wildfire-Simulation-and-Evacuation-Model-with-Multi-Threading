# Agent-Based Wildfire Simulation and Evacuation Model with Multi-Threading

## Overview
This project is an agent-based simulation model designed to study wildfire spread and evacuation strategies. The model leverages multi-threading to efficiently simulate the interactions between fire, environment, and agents (such as people or vehicles) in a dynamic landscape.

## Features
- Agent-based modeling of wildfire spread
- Simulation of evacuation strategies
- Multi-threaded execution for improved performance
- Visualization of fire and agent movement

## Requirements
- NetLogo (for running `.nlogo` model files)
- (Optional) Python or other tools for data analysis (not included in this repo)

## Getting Started
1. Open the `New fire (2) (1) (1).nlogo` file in NetLogo.
2. Run the simulation to observe wildfire spread and agent evacuation.
3. Adjust parameters in the NetLogo interface to experiment with different scenarios.

## Files
- `New fire (2) (1) (1).nlogo`: NetLogo model file for the simulation.
- `Agent-Based Modeling (ABM).docx`: Documentation or report on the model.
